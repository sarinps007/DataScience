They are used extensively in various fields of mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:\r\n\r\n1. **Addition**: Adding two or more numbers together.\r\n   - Example: \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\)\r\n\r\n2. **Subtraction**: Finding the difference between two numbers.\r\n   - Example: \\( 10 - 4 = 6 \\)\r\n\r\n3. **Multiplication**: Performing repeated addition of one number (the multiplicand) a certain number of times (the multiplier).\r\n   - Example: \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\)\r\n\r\n4. **Division**: Sharing a quantity into equal parts or finding out how many times one number is contained within another.\r\n   - Example: \\( \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\)\r\n\r\n5. **Exponentiation**: Raising a number to a certain power.\r\n   - Example: \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) (2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8)\r\n\r\n6. **Modulus**: Finding the remainder when one number is divided by another.\r\n   - Example: \\( 10 \\mod 3 = 1 \\) (The remainder when 10 is divided by 3 is 1)\r\n\r\nArithmetic expressions can be combined and nested to perform more complex calculations. They form the basis of mathematical operations in programming languages, spreadsheets, and various computational tools.\r\n",
